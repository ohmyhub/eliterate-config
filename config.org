* _Eliterate Config: A hot mess_
I am not an organized person. The system I use to organize my life is based
around loosely categorized piles. However, I find literate programming
fascinating and I decided try the literate configuration approach to Emacs.
Thank you to all the individuals who have crafted some amazing literate configs
that I have the benefit of stealing bits and pieces from. People like:
+ [[https://github.com/tecosaur/emacs-config/blob/master/config.org][@tecosaur]]
+ [[https://github.com/elken/.doom.d][@elken]]
+ [[https://github.com/zzamboni/dot-doom][@zzamboni]]
+ [[https://github.com/jeetelongname/dotfiles/blob/master/config/linked/doom/config.org][@jeetelongname]]
and many others I'm sure I've forgotten about. Also, thank you Henrik Lissner
for the time and effort you have spent developing the delightful Doom Emacs. I
use primary use Emacs as a note taking platform for work and D&D campaigns. From
time to time I'll do some actually coding in it but generally speaking I'm
someone who aspires to be a programming /hobbyist/.

What you are about to witness is a perpetual work in progress. It won't be
pretty, but it might be interesting.

** _The Basics_
*** Step One
+ Make this file run (slightly) faster with lexical binding (see [[https://nullprogram.com/blog/2016/12/22/][this blog post]]
  for more info).
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
;;; config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
#+end_src

*** Personal Information
+ Who am I? This is used by GPG and all sorts of other things.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
;; user info
(setq user-full-name "Kevin Ward"
      user-mail-address "mail@kevinward.xyz")
#+end_src

+ I've had some issues with GPG and epa that I hope will be resolved by the
  following settings.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(setq auth-source-cache-expiry 86400
      password-cache-expiry 86400)
#+end_src

** _Quality of Life Improvements_
*** Better Defaults
+ Where is my org directory located? This is a little out of place but it needs
  to be set before org loads.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
;; where the org at?
(setq org-directory "~/Dropbox/Org/")
#+end_src

+ This might as well go here. At the moment I only use roam for daily
  journaling. Someday I might get around to using more of it's functionality.

*** Helpful Functions
+ A helpful individual over on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/f63n53/is_there_an_easy_way_to_insert_an_image_link/fi46wpr/][reddit]] threw together this lovely function that
